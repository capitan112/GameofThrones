# Tech Test

Language: Swift 5

Have been provided with an in-development iOS app. The application uses an open API to display lists of data about the show "Game of Thrones".

## Fixed:

- App crashes on launch
- Book data does not display
- Overlapping text in the cells

There are also some undocumented issues that have been discovered.

## Improved the app

In addition to this work a further feature needs to be added that would allow a user to search the lists by name.
